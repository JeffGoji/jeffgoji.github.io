# 1. HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This is my completed Code Refractor project #1 for the Rice University Full-Stack Bootcamp.

The purpose of the project was to refractor it to a set criteria as listed below:

"GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title"

Another rule for any project is to leave the code cleaner then how I found it, so I rolled several CSS styling elements into one and removed code that broke the "DRY" (don't repeat yourself) rule.

Be sure to download the index.html file and the assets folder. Code will not work without both downloaded to the same destination.
