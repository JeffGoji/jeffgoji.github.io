Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio for the second challenge in the Rice University Full-Stack Developer bootcamp (Module 2).
The website is mobile compatible using the CSS Flex container system, and the navigation menu is mobile friendly with the traditional "hamburger icon" to access the site links.

**Projects:**
All four projects listed are projects I have completed at various points in time.
I built the JeffGoji.com Website long before I began using GIT or Github, so it and the JavaScript Guess my Number game are both hosted on their own web servers so the repositories I created for them do not have any commit history in them.

This is how the website should look when viewed:

Thank you for checking out my project, I hope you enjoy viewing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
